In the deepest sense of the word, a friend is someone who sees more potential in you than you see in yourself, someone who helps you become the best version of yourself.
Friendship can be hard to define by looking at the company we typically keep. Relationships on one level are offerings of mutually beneficial transaction. You scratch mine and I'll scratch yours. That's fine. But true friendship exists, and even transacts within a tacit implication of mutual elevation. A position where both people truly want the best for each other. You can keep someone around because they make you feel better about yourself, or because they're good for your image, or because because because.
