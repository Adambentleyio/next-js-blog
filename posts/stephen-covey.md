Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And desire is the motivation, the want to do. In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three.
And by habit I think Stephen means improve your relationship. I think he means taking the leap into your side hustle. Getting back to your ideal weight. Knowledge is power, but only if you deploy it. Your efforts go noticed but only with enough staying power. Your output goes recognised but only when it is useful. You first make your habits and then your habits make you. May the force be with you padawan
